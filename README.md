# Image-Classification-Tool
This simple image classification tool is built using Python and the Tkinter library. It allows you to classify images using a pre-trained deep-learning model and also load custom models for classification.

## Features 👁️‍🗨️

- Load and display images.
- Classify images using a pre-trained InceptionV3 model.
- Load custom classification models.
- View classification results.

## Prerequisites👾👾👾

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries: tkinter, PIL (Pillow), TensorFlow, NumPy

## Getting Started💞💞

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the source code.

2. Install the required libraries if you haven't already:

   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow pillow

**Run the application by executing ["Tool.py"].**

**Use the "Select an Image" button to choose an image for classification.**

**By default, the tool will classify the image using the InceptionV3 model and display the results.**

**You can also load custom models using the "Load Custom Model" button.**

**Use the "Clear Results" button to clear the classification results.**
